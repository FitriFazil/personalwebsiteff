	<p style="text-align: justify; padding: 50px; font-family: monospace;">I love my family. I have 4 brothers and 3 sisters. Two of my sisters already married and two of my brothers also married. Let me share a little bit about all of them. let's begin from left to right of the picture above. At the left one, his name is Mohd Faris and he is my third oldest brother. Infront of him is his wife. Both of them are just married in 2022 and Alhamdulillah Allah has blessed them with their first baby at the end of 2022, which is last December. Next, on the left side of me in the picture, he is my oldest brother and his name is Mohd Faiz. He is an introvert person but really hardworking I think. Besides that, infront of me is my eldest sister, her name is Nur Fatin and on my left side is her husband which is my first brother in law. My eldest sister is one of my closest siblings and she is the one who often gives me guidance and advice to survive and learn about this world, I guess. On my eldest sister's lap was her first child, Rifqie. Moreover, on the right side of my eldest sister is my lovely mom and my mom name is Roslina binti Abdul Karim. I would say that I really really love my mom so much, even though sometimes my stupidity always come out when I talk with my mom. At the right side of my mom, is my second sister, her name is Nur Farah. She is a strongest women but always not think carefully before doing something. Behind her is my youngest brother. His name is Muhammad Fahmi. He is my closest siblings when I was kid. Both of us always played every games together from my ages 5 until 19, but now we need to focus on the right things and do the things right. At the right side of Fahmi is my second brother in law which is Farah's husband and on the right one is my second eldest brother which is Mohd Fauzi. Her wife is on the right side of my second sister. The baby on her wife lap is their first child and that's cute girl name is Aira. Last but not least, infront of my second eldest brother is my youngest sister and her name is Nur Fatimah. She is quite stubborn but really kindhearted person. </p>
